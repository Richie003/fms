So the Jews were exiled and settled in different lands(countries to be precise). Fast forward into the future the first world war happened (1914-1918) and the Germans lost, entered into a great depression and were humiliated by the ```Treaty of Versailles```. A new government came up in Germany(the Third Reich 1933-1945) and blamed the Jews for their misfortune and plight economically and politically (Anti-semitism). The Nazi's majored on antisemitism among other useless idealogies they had why? no one knows why Hitler had so much love for the Jews but this is where I'm heading too; If the Jews were in their own land nobody would have blamed them for misfortune and the *HOLOCAUST* wouldn't have been a thing to be documented in the books of history. So my dear Nigerians don't japa/migrate seeking greener pastures in another mans land don't even dare to feel relaxed history might repeat itself instead acquire the intel, skills and knowledge and come develop your own country(remember there's no place like home). It's obvious that there are drawbacks in the country but no one is coming to save us, foreign aid wouldn't do any good and the government are just in for their selfish gains so let's stop running from our problems and face them. Your Tech bro Uncle Richie.

### PROBLEM SOLVING ###

Problem solving is all about bridging the gap between where you are and where you want to be. It's the process of using your knowledge, skills, and creativity to overcome obstacles and find the best way to get from point A to point B.

Think of it like this: you're stuck in a maze. You know you want to reach the exit, but there are walls, twists, and turns blocking your way. Problem solving is like figuring out the best path through the maze, using clues, avoiding dead ends, and adapting your strategy as you go.
